**Baishaxi (白沙溪)** is arguably the most well-known producer of Qianliang tea (and Anhua heicha in general) today, so it likely needs no introduction. This tea was their first production of QLC since their bankrupty and restructuring in May 2007. With the reorganization and subsequent expansion, production volumes increased significantly compared to the earlier period between the resumption of Qianliang production in 1997 and the final pre-bankruptcy batch in 2006.

The 2007 QLC is tightly pressed and showcases the unmistakable “Baishaxi huajuan” character.

*Note: This tea may contain golden flowers (Jinhua/金花), a perfectly natural occurrence in certain heicha teas. Their development depends on factors like microbial activity, storage conditions, and time. However, individuals with Celiac Disease or severe gluten allergies should exercise caution, as we cannot guarantee that no wheat-based materials were involved at any stage of production.*
