**Baishaxi (白沙溪)** is arguably the most well-known producer of Qianliang tea (and Anhua heicha in general) today, so it likely needs no introduction. In 2010, the company was invited to participate in the World Expo in Shanghai, along with Yongtaifu (永泰福), making them the only two Anhua heicha-focused producers represented. This QLC was one of the teas made for that occasion.

The "World Expo" QLC, also known as *一卷千秋*, was produced in two sizes: **大世博** (large) and **小世博** ("small"), weighing approximately 62 kg and 41 kg, respectively. The larger version offered here is the rarer of the two, with only 159 logs produced in total.

From what is known, both versions were made using the same material—reportedly from **Gaomaerxi (高马二溪)**. They are quite similar to Baishaxi’s 2008 "Olympics" QLC. That tea also used Gaomaerxi material, followed a similar processing method, and was notably larger than a standard QLC.

Profile wise, this release stands apart from Baishaxi’s standard-line QLCs.

*Note: This tea may contain golden flowers (Jinhua/金花), a perfectly natural occurrence in certain heicha teas. Their development depends on factors like microbial activity, storage conditions, and time. However, individuals with Celiac Disease or severe gluten allergies should exercise caution, as we cannot guarantee that no wheat-based materials were involved at any stage of production.*
