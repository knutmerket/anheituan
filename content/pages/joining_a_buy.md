Thereâ€™s no shopping cart or checkout system. If you're interested in any tea, just **send an email** to:

**ðŸ“§ anheituanorders[at]gmail.com**  
*(replace `[at]` with `@` when sending)*

Feel free to use this email to:
- Ask questions about any of the teas
- Claim one or more teas

### ðŸ§¾ What Happens After You Email

1. You tell me what you'd like and where you want it shipped.  
2. I calculate:  
    - Product total  
    - Shipping cost + service fees via [shipforwarder.com](https://www.shipforwarder.com)  
    - Any PayPal fees I incur (forwarding payment to Shipforwarder)
3. I send you a breakdown and the total cost in **USD**.  
4. If youâ€™re happy with it, you pay to the same email address via PayPal.
