**Gaojiashan (高家山)** is a fairly big operation — not in the league of Baishaxi, Zhongcha, or Xiangyi, but in that tier of medium-sized Anhua heicha producers just below them. A common assessment is that their teas were more consistently good before the two brothers who ran the company split (around 2013), and that their productions have been more hit-or-miss since then. I haven’t had too many of their newer teas, but the ones I have tried support this idea.

That said, interesting productions do pop up from time to time — this is one of them. There’s definitely a gimmick factor to this first batch of their “Qianliang Fuzhuan” (not a qianliangcha with jinhua, but a fuzhuan made to the size of a qianliangcha!), but it supposedly uses good material (*though take the “wild and ancient trees” claim with a qianliang of salt*), has seen a nice transformation in the 11 years since it was pressed.

The 2014 production was limited to either 28 or 50 bricks (I have seen both numbers mentioned, and would guess the latter is the correct one). Another batch was made in 2018, also limited to 50 bricks.
