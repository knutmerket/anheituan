Thereâ€™s no shopping cart or checkout system. If you're interested in any tea(s), just send an email to:

**ðŸ“§ anheituanorder[at]gmail.com**  
*(replace `[at]` with `@` when sending)*

Feel free to use this email to:

- Ask questions about any of the teas
- Claim one or more teas

(I will try to respond as fast as possible, but it may sometimes take a couple of days.)

### ðŸ§¾ What Happens After You Email

1. You tell me what you'd like and where you want it shipped.  
2. I calculate:  
    - Product total
    - Shipping cost (I use [shipforwarder.com](https://www.shipforwarder.com))
3. I send you a breakdown and the total cost in USD, as well as a [Stripe payment link](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-links) that you can use to pay if you're happy with the total cost.
