**Gaojiashan (高家山)** is a fairly big operation — not in the league of Baishaxi, Zhongcha, or Xiangyi, but in that tier of medium-sized Anhua heicha producers one level below. A common assessment is that their teas were more consistently good before the two brothers who ran the company split (in 2013), and that their productions have been more hit-or-miss since then. I haven’t had too many of their newer teas, but the ones I have tried support this idea.

That said, interesting productions do pop up from time to time and this is one of them. There’s definitely a gimmick factor to this first batch of their “Qianliang Fuzhuan” (not a qianliangcha with jinhua, but a fuzhuan made to the size of a qianliangcha!), but it uses good tianjian material from Yuntaishan (*though take the “wild and ancient trees” claim with a qianliang of salt*) and has seen a nice transformation in the 11 years since it was pressed.

The 2014 production was limited to 50 bricks. Another batch of 50 bricks was made in 2018. That number may not sound all that low when you consider the weigh of these bricks (~1.5 tonnes of finished tea per batch), but for *qianliangcha logs* of similar size production numbers of three or (more commonly) four digits is what you typically see.
