**Gaojiashan (高家山)** is a fairly big operation — not in the league of Baishaxi, Zhongcha, or Xiangyi, but in that tier of medium-sized Anhua heicha producers one level below. A common assessment is that their teas were more consistently good before the two brothers who ran the company split (in 2013), and that their productions have been more hit-or-miss since then.

There isn’t much information available on the early Gaojiashan productions, but at least in the last few years before the company split there were several batches of hei- and huazhuans produced each year. I am told (from a source I trust) that there were (at least) three different production series – the "ordinary" (普通), the "exquisite" (精致) and the "old trees" (老树) (which *I believe* is also the name of an Italian epic spaghetti Western film). This brick (qualification date 2012/09/10) supposedly belongs to the latter of the three series (though the wrapper doesn't do much to distinguish this from the ordinary line besides the "特质" on the "quality grade" field). That's a supposedly on top of a supposedly right there, never mind the fact that Gaojiashan wasn't (and aren't) shy about putting the "WILD TEA" stickers on (almost) all their teas, and that "old trees" in Anhua Heicha seems to be used very liberally, sometimes for trees only > 50 years. (I shudder at the thought than in little more than a decade I myself could qualify as an old tree.)

But that's neither here nor there – the early Gaojiashan bricks are deservedly held in high regard by many (myself included) and are still available at a very decent price point.

Note: This tea may contain golden flowers (Jinhua/金花), a natural occurrence in certain heicha teas. Their development depends on factors like microbial activity, storage conditions, and time. However, individuals with Celiac Disease or severe gluten allergies should exercise caution, as we cannot guarantee that no wheat-based materials were involved at any stage of production.
